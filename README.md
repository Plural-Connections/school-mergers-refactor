Public repo containing code and data release for the [School Mergers paper](https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/4/3/pgaf050/8046446)

[The 74: School 'Pairings' Can Foster Racial, Socioeconomic Integration](https://www.the74million.org/article/new-research-school-pairings-can-foster-racial-socioeconomic-integration/)

## Pipeline

Check the READMEs of the respective folders for more detailed information.

1. [`mergers_core/`](./mergers_core) — Set up and run CP-SAT simulations
2. [`dashboard/`](./dashboard) — Summarize, plot, & map high-level impacts

The code for the [School Mergers Dashboard](https://mergers.schooldiversity.org/) is under [`dashboard/`](./dashboard).

## Necessary data

This code repo operates on a mass of CSV and shapes files which are available here: [`school_mergers_data.zip`](https://plural-connections.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/school-mergers/school_mergers_data.zip).
